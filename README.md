Credit to 'shamahoque' (https://github.com/shamahoque) for assembling this application. I'm only displaying it for demonstration purposes and to potentially learn some things from the example code. 

Built with the MERN stack, this lets you make a user account, create public posts, edit your profile information, view other people's activity on the network, as well as like, reply, and follow. Various CRUD operations are made possible with routes to and from the database triggered when certain actions are performed.
